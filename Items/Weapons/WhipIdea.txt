Idea for Whips:
it could be a more defensive melee subtree
so when you hit enemies they get confused and can't move
and whilst they aren't moving, you can move them around with the whip(edited)
hold to throw whip(edited)
let go to retract(edited)
enemies can act as weapons
so whilst they are confused, they will go in the general direction you sent them in after releasing the whip
and deal damage to other enemies(edited)
Y/N?
not sure how possible that is
you can grab them and throw them away
or stun them
we can make insta-retract have no knockback
but then bosses make you retract immediately
as you can't grab hold of them
it has to retract entirely first
and the point is that it is a tradeoff
Shall we make whips get crits if you release immediately
maybe instead of hold and throw any monster currently stunned with the whip can be knocked back a long distance?
