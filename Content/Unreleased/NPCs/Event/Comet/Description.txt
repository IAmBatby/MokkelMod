Comet Slime and Head are pretty equal
And then Cometbusters (the humanoids) are a bit less common
And the Starstroller UFO thingies are the most rare, they also spawn more Cometbusters
A bit rarer

The Comet Slimes jump and behave like the different spiky slimes(edited)
Comet Heads fly at you through blocks, getting faster the closer it is to you (if that's possible)
Oh and btw, the Comet Head should leave behind a trail of blue and orange dust too
But as I was saying, some Cometbusters run at you, occasionally doing a charge where it is much faster, leaving behind blue and orange dust. Others wield a gun (sprite needed) and run slower, occasionally shooting at you.
The Starstroller (UFO thingy) shoots barrages of lasers at you and fly around, while also calling down damaging comets from the sky. Sometimes it spawns Cometbusters.
(Both variants)
Comets fall frequently during the event. They deal damage to both Players and mobs (unsure about that). The ones the Starstroller calls down don't drop anything.
But the regular ones drop a comet item when hitting the ground
